# Linear algebra: vector spaces

COMP1021 Maths for Computer Science

---

## Concept map

See the [concept diagram](https://github.com/stevenaeola/linalg_lectures/blob/f7807997e745d8d48951b55c5dbeb154dd92149b/concepts.mmd)

Things in pink we will look at today

## More reading/watching

- Videos one and two in the series [Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) by [3blue1brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/)
- Chapter 1 and section 2.4 of [Maths for machine learning](https://mml-book.github.io/)

## Structures (equipped) with multiple operations

So far we have ignored multiplication
- A _field_ has two operations, usually written $+$ and $\cdot$
- Call them 'addition' and 'multiplication'
- In programming we are used to $+$ meaning different things

---

## Field axioms

- Look at the [classic definition of a field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)#Classic_definition)
- What terms are used that we haven't seen yet?
- Is a field also a group?
- Can every group be turned into a field?
- Can a field be finite?

---

## Structures with multiple sets

- Vectors are different from numbers (scalars)
- We can add vectors
- We can scale vectors (multiply)
- We can add scalars
- Can we multiply vectors?

## Vector space

- Is a mathematical structure: sets, operations, axioms
- Has two sets: scalars $F$ and vectors $V$
- $V$ forms a commutative group under addition $\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u}$
- $F$ forms a field (different kind of addition)
- Scalar multiplication $: F \times V \rightarrow V$

---

## Examples of vector spaces

<!-- .slide: class="fragmented-lists" -->

- $\Bbb{R}^3 = \Bbb{R} \times \Bbb{R} \times \Bbb{R}$ over $\Bbb{R}$ 
  - vectors in $\Bbb{R}^3$, scalars in $\Bbb{R}$
- $\Bbb{Z}_2^8$ over $\Bbb{Z}_2$
- polynomials over $\Bbb{R}$
- write down an example of scalar multiplication for each of these

---

## Notation conventions

- Write vector variables in bold $\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v} \in V$
- Alternatives are $\overline{v}, \underline{v}, \overrightarrow{v}$
- Write scalars plain $a,b \in F$
- Vectors in $\Bbb{R}^3$ as row $(1,-2,0)$ or column 

`$$\begin{pmatrix} 1\\-2\\0\end{pmatrix}$$`

---

<!-- .slide: class="fragmented-lists" -->

## Vector Space Axioms

- (commutative group and field axioms for vectors and scalars)
- $a(b\mathbf{v}) = (ab)\mathbf{v}$
- $1\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}$
- $a(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) = a\mathbf{u} + a\mathbf{v}$
- $(a + b)\mathbf{v} = a\mathbf{v} + b\mathbf{v}$
- [MML](https://mml-book.github.io/) 2.4.2 only talks about vectors over reals $\Bbb{R}$

## Linear combinations

__Defn__ Given vectors $\mathbf{v_1}, \ldots ,\mathbf{v_n}$ and scalars $a_1, \ldots ,a_n$

We can form a _linear combination_

$$ a_1\mathbf{v_1} + \ldots + a_n\mathbf{v_n}$$

Alternatively

$$ \sum_{i=1}^n a_i\mathbf{v_i} $$

---

<!-- .slide: class="fragmented-lists" -->

## Span

__Defn__ The set of all linear combinations of a set of vectors is called its _span_


- Describe (in words) the span of the set $\lbrace(0,1,0),(0,1,2)\rbrace$
- N.B. If the field is infinite then the span will be infinite (for a non-empty set)


---

## Spanning set

__Defn__ A set of vectors $S$ is a _spanning set_ for a vector space $(F,V)$ if $span(S)=V$

We can equivalently say $S$ spans $V$

## Summary

- Fields have one set and two operations, addition and multiplication, like the real numbers
- Vector space includes a group of vectors and a field of scalars, with axioms governing scalar multiplication
- We can form linear combinations of vectors through scaling and adding
- All of the linear combinations of a set is called the span
